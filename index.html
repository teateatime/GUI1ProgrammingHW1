Brief Overview: The site I created for hw 1 for GUI 1 is pretty much
a mini website portfolio using only html and css. Provides some information about me
including but not limited to my hobbies, interests, and favorite food. Also includes
links about some of my favorite food and how to make it and images.

            <p><a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/vietnamese-pho-recipe/">Pho</a>
            <br>A bone broth typically made up of multiple herbs,<br>
             including but not limited to bean sprouts, basil, and green onions.<br>It can also
            contain meatballs, thin slices of beef that are medium rare, rice noodles, and is overall a popular dish
            worldwide.<br>I generally like eating pho mainly due to how easy it is to make it.</p>

            <br>A spicy broth rice noodle dish that contains beef and multiple spices.<br>It also includes 
            several herbs and vegetables like green onions, bean sprouts, and shallots.<br>
            I typically like it due to how it offers packs more of a kick in spicyness compared to pho.</p>
